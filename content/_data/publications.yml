    "Visualizations are typically seen as tools for interpreting and ana
      lyzing data, yet in visualization-as-input systems, where users en
      ter information directly into a visual interface, the structure of the
      visualization may actively shape the data input by the user. This
      paper argues that visual aspects such as Scaffolding Elements (e.g.,
      axes, ranges, and labels) and Anchor Points (e.g., visualized data)
      influence what users perceive as appropriate, complete, and accu
      rate input. I outline a high level research agenda for the community
      to empirically study how these structural aspects guide user input.
      By reframing visualization-as-input as a dynamic way to elicit data,
      I highlight the need for design strategies that mitigate bias and pro
      mote more authentic and representative user data."

    "Visualization literacy, previously called graphicacy, relies on an analogy to textual literacy to communicate its intended meaning as the ability to use visualizations. However, there are two issues with this analogy: a mismatch where analysis contexts do not have an analogous place in textual literacy and an inherited dichotomy of literate vs. illiterate which does not accurately represent the spectrum of visualization skill. In this paper, we discuss existing literature and how it typically describes visualization literacy and the connection to textual literacy. We then propose new terminology, the visualization skillset, to provide more flexibility when discussing this ability and its spectrum of proficiency, and to provoke discussion on how to improve on the issues we identified. Finally, we discuss how to move forward as a field and propose directions for future work."

    "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, HealthLink BC (HLBC) rapidly integrated physicians into the triage process of their virtual healthcare service to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction with this service and preserve health care system capacity. We present the design and implementation of a visual analytics tool, VIVA (Virtual healthcare Interactions using Visual Analytics), to support HLBC in analysing various forms of usage data from the service. We abstract HLBC's data and data analysis tasks, which we use to inform our design of VIVA. We also present the interactive workflow abstraction of Scan, Act, Adapt. We validate VIVA's design through three case studies with stakeholder domain experts. We also propose the Controllability Through Configuration model to conduct and analyze design studies, and discuss architectural evolution of VIVA through that lens. It articulates configuration, both that specified by a developer or technical power user and that constructed automatically through log data from previous interactive sessions, as a bridge between the rigidity of hardwired programming and the time-consuming implementation of full end-user interactivity.

    "Designing multiscale visualizations, particularly when the ratio between the largest scale and the smallest item is large, can be challenging, and designers have developed many approaches to overcome this challenge. We present a design space for visualization with multiple scales. The design space includes three dimensions, with eight total subdimensions. We demonstrate its descriptive power by using it to code approaches from a corpus we compiled of 52 examples, created by a mix of academics and practitioners. We demonstrate descriptive power by analyzing and partitioning these examples into four high-level strategies for designing multiscale visualizations, which are shared approaches with respect to design space dimension choices. We demonstrate generative power by analyzing missed opportunities within the corpus of examples, identified through analysis of the design space, where we note how certain examples could have benefited from different choices. We discuss patterns in the use of different dimension and strategy choices in the different visualization contexts of analysis and presentation. Supplemental materials: https://osf.io/wbrdm/.

    "An 'invariant descriptor' captures meaningful structural features of networks, useful where traditional visualizations, like node-link views, face challenges like the 'hairball phenomenon' (inscrutable overlap of points and lines). Designing invariant descriptors involves balancing abstraction and information retention, as richer data summaries demand more storage and computational resources. Building on prior work, chiefly the BMatrix-a matrix descriptor visualized as the invariant 'network portrait' heatmap-we introduce BFS-Census, a new algorithm computing our Census data structures: Census-Node, Census-Edge, and Census-Stub. Our experiments show Census-Stub, which focuses on 'stubs' (half-edges), has orders of magnitude greater discerning power (ability to tell non-isomorphic graphs apart) than any other descriptor in this study, without a difficult trade-off: the substantial increase in resolution doesn't come at a commensurate cost in storage space or computation power. We also present new visualizations-our Hop-Census polylines and Census-Census trajectories-and evaluate them using real-world graphs, including a sensitivity analysis that shows graph topology change maps to visual Census change."

    "We offer a new model of the sensemaking process for data analysis and visualization. Whereas past sensemaking models have been grounded in positivist assumptions about the nature of knowledge, we reframe data sensemaking in critical, humanistic terms by approaching it through an interpretivist lens. Our three-phase process model uses the analogy of an iceberg, where data is the visible tip of underlying schemas. In the Add phase, the analyst acquires data, incorporates explicit schemas from the data, and absorbs the tacit schemas of both data and people. In the Check phase, the analyst interprets the data with respect to the current schemas and evaluates whether the schemas match the data. In the Refine phase, the analyst considers the role of power, articulates what was tacit into explicitly stated schemas, updates data, and formulates findings. Our model has four important distinguishing features: Tacit and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact, and Schematic Multiplicity. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas in different academic traditions. We validate the descriptive and prescriptive power of our model through four analysis scenarios: noticing uncollected data, learning to wrangle data, downplaying inconvenient data, and measuring with sensors. We conclude by discussing the value of interpretivism, the virtue of epistemic humility, and the pluralism this sensemaking model can foster."

    "While previous work has found success in deploying visualizations as museum exhibits, it has not investigated whether museum context impacts visitor behaviour with these exhibits. We present an interactive Deep-time Literacy Visualization Exhibit (DeLVE) to help museum visitors understand deep time (lengths of extremely long geological processes) by improving proportional reasoning skills through comparison of different time periods. DeLVE uses a new visualization idiom, Connected Multi-Tier Ranges, to visualize curated datasets of past events across multiple scales of time, relating extreme scales with concrete scales that have more familiar magnitudes and units. Museum staff at three separate museums approved the deployment of DeLVE as a digital kiosk, and devoted time to curating a unique dataset in each of them. We collect data from two sources, an observational study and system trace logs. We discuss the importance of context: similar museum exhibits in different contexts were received very differently by visitors. We additionally discuss differences in our process from Sedlmair et al.'s design study methodology which is focused on design studies triggered by connection with collaborators rather than the discovery of a concept to communicate.

    Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of powerful machine learning tools
    that model node relations for making predictions of nodes or links. GNN
    developers rely on quantitative metrics of the predictions to evaluate a
    GNN, but similar to many other neural networks, it is difficult for them to
    understand if the GNN truly learns characteristics of a graph as expected.
    We propose an approach to corresponding an input graph to its node embedding
    (aka latent space), a common component of GNNs that is later used for
    prediction. We abstract the data and tasks, and develop an interactive
    multi-view interface called CorGIE to instantiate the abstraction. As the
    key function in CorGIE, we propose the K-hop graph layout to show
    topological neighbors in hops and their clustering structure. To evaluate
    the functionality and usability of CorGIE, we present how to use CorGIE in
    two usage scenarios, and conduct a case study with two GNN experts.

    Visualization collections, accessed by platforms such as Tableau Online or
    Power BI, are used by millions of people to share and access diverse
    analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization bundles.
    Result snippets, compact previews of these bundles, are presented to users
    to help them identify relevant content when browsing collections. Our
    engagement with Tableau product teams and review of existing snippet designs
    on five platforms showed us that current practices fail to help people judge
    the relevance of bundles because they include only the title and one image.
    Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a
    bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and
    dashboards. In response, we contribute the first systematic approach to
    visualization snippet design. We propose a framework for snippet design that
    addresses eight key challenges that we identify. We present a computational
    pipeline to compress the visual and textual content of bundles into
    representative previews that is adaptive to a provided pixel budget and
    provides high information density with multiple images and carefully chosen
    keywords.

    Genomic Epidemiology (genEpi) is a branch of public health that uses many
    different data types including tabular, network, genomic, and geographic, to
    identify and contain outbreaks of deadly diseases. Due to the volume and
    variety of data, it is challenging for genEpi domain experts to conduct data
    reconnaissance; that is, have an overview of the data they have and make
    assessments toward its quality, completeness, and suitability. We present an
    algorithm for data reconnaissance through automatic visualization
    recommendation, GEViTRec. Our approach handles a broad variety of dataset
    types and automatically generates visually coherent combinations of charts,
    in contrast to existing systems that primarily focus on singleton visual
    encodings of tabular datasets. We automatically detect linkages across
    multiple input datasets by analyzing non-numeric attribute fields, creating
    a data source graph within which we analyze and rank paths. For each
    high-ranking path, we specify chart combinations with positional and color
    alignments between shared fields, using a gradual binding approach to
    transform initial partial specifications of singleton charts to complete
    specifications that are aligned and oriented consistently. A novel aspect of
    our approach is its combination of domain-agnostic elements with
    domain-specific information that is captured through a domain-specific
    visualization prevalence design space. Our implementation is applied to both
    synthetic data and real Ebola outbreak data. We compare GEViTRec's output to
    what previous visualization recommendation systems would generate, and to
    manually crafted visualizations used by practitioners. We conducted
    formative evaluations with ten genEpi experts to assess the relevance and
    interpretability of our results.

- abstract:
    Cloud-based visualization services have made visual analytics accessible to
    a much wider audience than ever before. Systems such as Tableau have started
    to amass increasingly large repositories of analytical knowledge in the form
    of interactive visualization workbooks. When shared, these collections can
    form a visual analytic knowledge base. However, as the size of a collection
    increases, so does the difficulty in finding relevant information.
    Content-based recommendation (CBR) systems could help analysts in finding
    and managing workbooks relevant to their interests. Toward this goal, we
    focus on text-based content that is representative of the subject matter of
    visualizations rather than the visual encodings and style. We discuss the
    challenges associated with creating a CBR based on visualization
    specifications and explore more concretely how to implement the relevance
    measures required using Tableau workbook specifications as the source of
    content data. We also demonstrate what information can be extracted from
    these visualization specifications and how various natural language
    processing techniques can be used to compute similarity between workbooks as
    one way to measure relevance. We report on a crowd-sourced user study to
    determine if our similarity measure mimics human judgement. Finally, we
    choose latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as a specific model and instantiate
    it in a proof-of-concept recommender tool to demonstrate the basic function
    of our similarity measure.

    "Data visualization is an important tool for exploring and communicating
    findings from genomic and healthcare datasets. Yet, without a systematic way
    of organizing and describing the design space of data visualizations,
    researchers may not be aware of the breadth of possible visualization design
    choices or how to distinguish between good and bad options. We have
    developed a method that systematically surveys data visualizations using the
    analysis of both text and images. Our method supports the construction of a
    visualization design space that is explorable along two axes: why the
    visualization was created and how it was constructed. We applied our method
    to a corpus of scientific research articles from infectious disease genomic
    epidemiology and derived a Genomic Epidemiology Visualization Typology
    (GEViT) that describes how visualizations were created from a series of
    chart types, combinations, and enhancements. We have also implemented an
    online gallery that allows others to explore our resulting design space of
    visualizations. Our results have important implications for visualization
    design and for researchers intending to develop or use data visualization
    tools. Finally, the method that we introduce is extensible to constructing

    different strategies to obtain a more manageable dataset for further
    analysis. Adjutant makes explicit trade-offs between speed and accuracy,
    which are modifiable by the user, such that a complete analysis of several

    "Domain experts are inundated with new and heterogeneous types of data and
    require better and more specific types of data visualization systems to help
    them. In this paper, we consider the data landscape that domain experts seek
    to understand, namely the set of datasets that are either currently
    available or could be obtained. Experts need to understand this landscape to
    triage which data analysis projects might be viable, out of the many
    possible research questions that they could pursue. We identify data
    reconnaissance and task wrangling as processes that experts undertake to
    discover and identify sources of data that could be valuable for some
    specific analysis goal. These processes have thus far not been formally
    named or defined by the research community. We provide formal definitions of
    data reconnaissance and task wrangling and describe how they relate to the
    data landscape that domain experts must uncover. We propose a conceptual
    framework with a four-phase cycle of acquire, view, assess, and pursue that
    occurs within three distinct chronological stages, which we call fog and
    friction, informed data ideation, and demarcation of final data.
    Collectively, these four phases embedded within three temporal stages
    delineate an expert - progressively evolving understanding of the data
    landscape. We describe and provide concrete examples of these processes
    within the visualization community through an initial systematic analysis of
    previous design studies, identifying situations where there is evidence that
    they were at play. We also comment on the response of domain experts to this
    framework, and suggest design implications stemming from these processes to
    motivate future research directions. As technological changes will only keep
    adding unknown terrain to the data landscape, data reconnaissance and task
    wrangling are important processes that need to be more widely understood and
    supported by the data visualization tools. By articulating a concrete
    understanding of this challenge and its implications, our work impacts the
    design and evaluation of data visualization systems."

    Clickstream data has the potential to provide insights into e-commerce
    consumer behavior, but previous techniques fall short of handling the scale
    and complexity of real-world datasets because they require relatively clean
    and small input. We present Segmentifier, a novel visual analytics interface
    that supports an iterative process of refining collections of action
    sequences into meaningful segments. We present task and data abstractions
    for clickstream data analysis, leading to a high-level model built around an
    iterative view-refine-record loop with outcomes of conclude with an answer,
    export segment for further analysis in downstream tools, or abandon the
    question for a more fruitful analysis path. Segmentifier supports fast and
    fluid refinement of segments through tightly coupled visual encoding and
    interaction with a rich set of views that show evocative derived attributes
    for segments, sequences, and actions in addition to underlying raw
    sequences. These views support fast and fluid refinement of segments through
    filtering and partitioning attribute ranges. Interactive visual queries on
    custom action sequences are aggregated according to a three-level hierarchy.
    Segmentifier features a detailed glyph-based visual history of the
    automatically recorded analysis process showing the provenance of each
    segment as an analysis path of attribute constraints. We demonstrate the
    effectiveness of our approach through a usage scenario with real-world data
    and a case study documenting the insights gained by a corporate e-commerce
    analyst.

    and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices characterized by three
    dimensions: representation, scale, and layout. Twenty combinations of these
    choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different
    narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points
    allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both
    interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design
    space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions
    in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven
    example timeline stories. Ultimately, this work is intended to inform and
    inspire the design of future tools for storytelling with timelines."

- abstract:
    Problem-based visualization research provides explicit guidance toward
    identifying and designing for the needs of users, but absent is more
    concrete guidance toward factors external to a user's needs that also have
    implications for visualization design and evaluation. This lack of more
    explicit guidance can leave visualization researchers and practitioners
    vulnerable to unforeseen constraints beyond the user's needs that can affect
    the validity of evaluations, or even lead to the premature termination of a
    project. Here we explore two types of external constraints in depth,
    regulatory and organizational constraints, and describe how these
    constraints impact visualization design and evaluation. By borrowing from
    techniques in software development, project management, and visualization
    research we recommend strategies for identifying, mitigating, and evaluating
    these external constraints through a design study methodology. Finally, we
    present an application of those recommendations in a healthcare case study.
    We argue that by explicitly incorporating external constraints into
    visualization design and evaluation, researchers and practitioners can
    improve the utility and validity of their visualization solution and improve
    the likelihood of successful collaborations with industries where external
    constraints are more present.

- abstract:
    "A multiplex network has links of different types, allowing it to express
    many overlapping types of relationships. A core task in network analysis is
    to evaluate and understand group cohesion; that is, to explain why groups of
    elements belong together based on the underlying structure of the network.
    We present Detangler, a system that supports visual analysis of group
    cohesion in multiplex networks through dual linked views. These views
    feature new data abstractions derived from the original multiplex network:
    the substrate network and the catalyst network. We contribute two novel
    techniques that allow the user to analyze the complex structure of the
    multiplex network without the extreme visual clutter that would result from
    simply showing it directly. The harmonized layout visual encoding technique
    provides spatial stability between the substrate and catalyst views. The
    pivot brushing interaction technique supports linked highlighting between
    the views based on computations in the underlying multiplex network to
    leapfrog between subsets of catalysts and substrates. We present results
    from the motivating application domain of annotated news documents with a
    usage scenario and preliminary expert feedback. A second usage scenario
    presents group cohesion analysis of the social network of the early American
    independence movement."

    Reflections on the design of a system for visualizing a high-dimensional
    environmental sustainability dataset. Despite some successes on designing
    visual encoding and interaction techniques, QuestVis was ultimately not
    deployed because of a mismatch between the design goals of the project and
    the true needs of the target user community. We analyze this breakdown in
    the context of the Nested Model framework, which was motivated in part by
    this experience.

    This report, sponsored by the NIH and NSF, is a followup to the 1987 NSF
    Visualization report. Our goal is to evaluate the progress of the maturing
    field of visualization, to help focus and direct future research projects,
    and to provide guidance on how to apportion national resources. Our findings
    and recommendations reflect not only information gathered from visualization
    and applications scientists during two workshops on Visualization Research
    Challenges but also input from the larger visualization community.

    A paper which presents the H3Viewer guaranteed frame rate drawing algorithm,
    along with a brief review of the H3 layout algorithm for context. Very large
    graphs can be navigated at a constant frame rate, as long as the entire
    graph can fit into main memory. The viewer is custom OpenGL/C++ code. My
    implementation of the algorithm discussed here was shipped with the Site
    Manager 1.1 software from SGI. The source is available for free

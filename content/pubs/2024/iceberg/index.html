						The Iceberg Sensemaking Model depicts how a data analyst may use Datasets, Explicit Schemas, and Tacit Schemas to develop Findings through a critical sensemaking process. The wavy waterline separates the Tacit Schemas below from the Explicit Schemas, Datasets, and Findings above. Data Sources and People are external sources of the schemas that eventually become Datasets. The analyst is directed to consider the role of power, in the broad sense of social influence or ideology, to inform their articulation of Tacit Schemas. Actions are classified into three phases (Add, Check, and Refine). The sensemaking process can loop back to any previous phase before reaching a conclusion when Findings are finalized.

					We offer a new model of the sensemaking process for data analysis and visualization. Whereas past sensemaking models have been grounded in positivist assumptions about the nature of knowledge, we reframe data sensemaking in critical, humanistic terms by approaching it through an interpretivist lens. Our three-phase process model uses the analogy of an iceberg, where data is the visible tip of underlying schemas. In the Add phase, the analyst acquires data, incorporates explicit schemas from the data, and absorbs the tacit schemas of both data and people. In the Check phase, the analyst interprets the data with respect to the current schemas and evaluates whether the schemas match the data. In the Refine phase, the analyst considers the role of power, articulates what was tacit into explicitly stated schemas, updates data, and formulates findings. Our model has four important distinguishing features: Tacit and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact, and Schematic Multiplicity. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas in different academic traditions. We validate the descriptive and prescriptive power of our model through four analysis scenarios: noticing uncollected data, learning to wrangle data, downplaying inconvenient data, and measuring with sensors. We conclude by discussing the value of interpretivism, the virtue of epistemic humility, and the pluralism this sensemaking model can foster.</a>
